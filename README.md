Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) Model for Streamflow Prediction and Climate Scenario Forecasting
Overview

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to predict streamflow using historical climate data and generate future streamflow predictions under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios: SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. The TFT model is designed to leverage temporal patterns and feature dependencies effectively by combining dynamic climate variables and lagged streamflow data.
Project Details

    Objective: Predict streamflow based on past climate and hydrological data and assess future streamflow patterns under different climate scenarios.
    Data Sources: Historical climate data (Monthly data.xlsx) and climate scenario projections for SSP2-4.5 (SSP245.xlsx) and SSP5-8.5 (SSP585.xlsx).
    Approach:
        Variable Selection Network (VSN): Identifies relevant features using a Gated Residual Network (GRN) for each feature.
        Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT): Integrates VSN, LSTM layers, and GRN to capture temporal dependencies and complex interactions.
        Predictions: Evaluate the model on a test set and predict future streamflow based on SSP scenario data.

Key Files

    Data Preparation:
        Preprocesses climate data by adding lagged streamflow features for improved temporal insights.
        Scales the features and streamflow target variable using MinMaxScaler.

    Model Definition:
        Variable Selection Network (VSN): Selects features dynamically based on Gated Residual Networks (GRNs) and a sigmoid-based feature selection layer.
        Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT): Core model for streamflow prediction, combining VSN, LSTM, and GRN layers.

    Training and Evaluation:
        Splits data into training and testing sets (70/30 split).
        Trains the model using mean absolute error (MAE) as the loss function.
        Evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

    Future Streamflow Predictions:
        Generates future predictions under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.
        Stores results in separate Excel files for easy access and plotting.
